                <h2>Rally against the surveillance state and repression<br>
                    09.30.23, 15:00h Hansaplatz</h2>
                <b>The Hansaplatz is currently being monitored with artificial intelligence (AI) on a trial basis. With
                    this, the
                    police want to set a precedent, to make AI-based video surveillance socially acceptable and later
                    use it in other places,
                    such as Hamburg's central station. This is not about security, but about the displacement of
                    homeless, drug-users,
                    sex workers and other groups of people.
                    Genuine support measures are thus made more difficult and the safety of those affected is threatened
                    instead.
                    We therefore demand an immediate end to surveillance and repression!
                </b>
                <div class="social-media">
                    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/buendnishansaplatz"><img alt="Instagram"

                </div>
                In a current test project, the police are using artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze the data from
                the video cameras on the Hansaplatz. The aim is to recognize 'atypical movement patterns'. These include
                falling, kicking, punching, pushing or even lying down. This is justified on the grounds of greater
                safety and more efficient police work.</br>
                </br>
                Although the current implementation of AI is not intended to include identification through facial
                recognition (other identification options have not yet been mentioned, but are presumably not yet being
                implemented either), the movements and posture of people are often sufficient for identification. This
                is an attack on fundamental rights and makes anonymous movement in public places or participation in
                demonstrations more difficult!
                Every expansion of surveillance also normalizes such measures and leads to them becoming ever more
                drastic.</br>
                </br>
                The Senate and the police have already cracked down on homeless people in the past. Added to this is the
                austerity policy of the current government, which envisages drastic cuts in the social sector and thus
                exacerbates existing problems.
                In these times, AI-based video surveillance at the Hansaplatz is presented as a simple solution to urban
                problems and fits as an additional piece of the puzzle in a policy that is heavily influenced by
                investors and real estate companies and is directed against people who do not fit into the ideal image
                of a tourist-friendly city.
                AI surveillance is an instrument for the further displacement of homeless people as well as people who
                use drugs,
                sex workers and other groups of people.</br>
                </br>
                Scientific studies prove that video surveillance does not prevent crime. Existing problems are not
                solved, but shifted to side streets and rear buildings.
                There, the risks for the people involved become significantly greater instead of smaller. So we ask
                ourselves who actually defines safety and whose safety should be ensured:
                For passers-by, homeless or drug-using people, sex workers or others for whom Hansaplatz is a place of
                refuge?
                Or is it more about the security of the economic interests of investors, politicians and real estate
                companies?</br>
                </br>

                Instead of shifting the problems by fighting against people through surveillance and repression, we
                demand an improvement in the circumstances that cause these real problems.</br>
                Let's set an example together!</br>
